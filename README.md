# Biweekly Report
# Thoon Nguyen

My goal for this week's biweekly report is to learn how to use PyTorch and TensorFlow. I have no prior experience with Python, PyTorch, or TensorFlow, so these datasets were chosen for their simplicity. I choose one dataset that had tabular data and one image based dataset. Each notebook is self standing and can be view in any order.
## Iris_Model_Predicition.ipynb
In this file I learn how use TensorFlow to create a classification model for the Iris dataset. The choice to use TensorFlow vs Pytorch here was arbitrary, but I went with the Iris data set because it is tabular data, small, and well studied. My main focus was on learning about TensorFlow.
## CIFAR10EDA.ipynb
Since I used TensorFlow in the other report, I will use PyTorch here. I chose the CIFAR10 dataset because I wanted to practice analyzing images. I choose this dataset specifically because it was colored and has a variety of images to classify.
